## Trusts

Trusts are a key part of the "Wealth Defense Industry" (Collins 2021), and
make use of a convenient legal fiction: when a trust is created, it is treated
as the creator parting with their assets, despite the fact that they still hold
those assets and can benefit from them. The effect is a strange legal form of 
ambiguous ownership in which no one is taxed: the person who created the trust
no longer owns the assets... but the trustee doesn't either, as the trustee is
just watching over the assets. The beneficiaries don't own the assets because
they have not yet been distrusted.

A few notes on trust in general. A trust is made by a "creator" or "grantor." A
"trustee" is a person who manages it and enforces the trust agreement. A grantor
can be a trustee, or a trustees can be a professional (e.g., a lawyer or banker).
"Beneficiaries" are people who will benefit from the assets---in family trusts,
for example, children become the beneficiaries after the grantor dies. 

Assets held in trust do not have to go through probate---trustees access and 
distribute them according to the trust agreement. This has privacy benefits,
because assets don't appear in court register. It also helps trustees and
beneficiaries avoid gift and estate taxes.

### Realty/Real Estate/Nominee Trust

Distinct from other forms of trust in the sense that the
trustees can only act in the "express interest" of the beneficiaries. Trustees
hold legal title, but beneficiaries hold "equitable title." These are apparently
a quirk of Massachusetts law---until 2003, Massachusetts required that the 
complete trust be recorded by the register of deeds, which subverted the privacy
of a living trust. Lawyers then structured ownership in layers: an attorney
establishes a realty trust for the living trust, who was the sole beneficial
owner, keeping the beneficiary confidential. An LLC can also be a trustee or
beneficiary. Transactions involving property within realty trusts don't have to
recorded, meaning family homes can be gifted over time through incremental
annual gifts.

### Living Trusts

In a living trust, the grantor is usually the trustee and control the assets 
until their death, at which point the assets are distributed according to the 
trust agreement. The assets held in a living trust can be distributed to a
wide range of beneficiaries, even those outside the family. (Colleges, 
foundations, pets.) Living trusts can  be either revocable or irrevocable 
trusts.

### Family Trust

A family trust outlives its creator. A family trust distributes assets based on
life events (e.g., marriage, graduation from college), and funds can only be 
distributed to beneficiaries in the family. A family trust can also be revocable or irrevocable.

### Revocable Trust

The creator of a revocable trust can amend, add, or revoke the trust during the
grantors lifetime. Usually becomes irrevocable after death of grantor. Basically,
this is a trust in which the grantor retains control. These offer fewer benefits
for protecting assets from creditors---for example, accessing a health benefit
may require that grantors draw on assets held in trust.

### Irrevocable Trust

In an irrevocable trust, grantors cannot change the trust after it is created.
These are primarily used to protect generational wealth, protecting insurance
policies and properties. A more secure form of asset protection, as they are not
subject to requirements that they be drawn down to access, e.g., health benefits.
